# 🖼️ Dynamic Image Slider

A **Dynamic Image Slider** project that allows users to view and navigate through a collection of images with smooth transitions and interactive controls. This slider can be used for websites, portfolios, or galleries to showcase visual content in an appealing and responsive way.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 🎞️ **Automatic Slideshow** — Images transition automatically after a set interval.
* ⏸️ **Manual Controls** — Next/Previous buttons to navigate through images manually.
* ⚡ **Dynamic Image Loading** — Images can be loaded dynamically from an array, folder, or API.
* 📱 **Responsive Design** — Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* ✨ **Customizable Transitions** — Fade, slide, or zoom effects for smooth image changes.
* 🔁 **Infinite Loop Option** — The slider can loop images endlessly.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **HTML5** — Structure of the slider
* **CSS3** — Styling and transitions
* **JavaScript (ES6)** — Dynamic functionality and interactivity
* *(Optional)* Frameworks/Libraries: React, jQuery, or GSAP (if used)

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-image-slider.git
   ```
2. **Open the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd dynamic-image-slider
   ```
3. **Run the project:**

   * Open `index.html` in your browser.
   * Or use a local development server (like VS Code Live Server).

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The JavaScript file dynamically fetches image paths and injects them into the slider container.
2. Timer-based or button-triggered events change the active image.
3. CSS transitions create a smooth fade or slide effect between images.

---

## 🎨 Customization

* Change the **transition time** in `script.js`.
* Update **CSS** to modify animation effects or layout.
* Add or remove images from the `/images` folder or change the source in the JavaScript array.

Would you like me to make this README more **technical** (e.g., include code examples and API logic) or more **presentation-focused** (like for a portfolio or submission)?
